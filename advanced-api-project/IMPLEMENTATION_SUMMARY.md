# Implementation Summary

This document provides a detailed explanation of how the nested relationships and validation have been implemented in this Django REST Framework project.

## Nested Relationships Implementation

### Author-Book Relationship

The relationship between Author and Book models is implemented as a one-to-many relationship using Django's ForeignKey:

```python
# In models.py
class Book(models.Model):
    author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='books')
```

This creates a ForeignKey from Book to Author with:
- `on_delete=models.CASCADE`: When an author is deleted, all their books are also deleted
- `related_name='books'`: Allows reverse lookups from author to books (author.books.all())

### Nested Serialization

The nested serialization is implemented in the AuthorSerializer:

```python
# In serializers.py
class AuthorSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    books = BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)
    
    class Meta:
        model = Author
        fields = ['id', 'name', 'books']
```

Key aspects:
- `BookSerializer(many=True, read_only=True)`: 
  - `many=True` indicates multiple books will be serialized
  - `read_only=True` prevents books from being modified through this serializer
- When an Author instance is serialized, all related books are automatically included
- The nested books use the BookSerializer, which includes all book fields and validation

### How It Works

When you retrieve an author through the API:
1. The AuthorSerializer is used to serialize the author instance
2. The serializer automatically follows the `related_name='books'` to get all related books
3. Each book is serialized using the BookSerializer
4. The final JSON includes the author data and a nested array of books

Example output:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "books": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "title": "Sample Book",
      "publication_year": 2023,
      "author": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

## Validation Implementation

### Custom Validation in BookSerializer

The BookSerializer includes custom validation to ensure the publication_year is not in the future:

```python
# In serializers.py
def validate_publication_year(self, value):
    from datetime import datetime
    current_year = datetime.now().year
    if value > current_year:
        raise serializers.ValidationError("Publication year cannot be in the future.")
    return value
```

How it works:
1. The method is automatically called by DRF when validating the `publication_year` field
2. It compares the provided year with the current year
3. If the year is in the future, it raises a ValidationError
4. Otherwise, it returns the validated value

### Validation Process

When creating or updating a book:
1. The serializer's `is_valid()` method is called
2. DRF automatically calls `validate_publication_year` for the publication_year field
3. If validation fails, the error is added to `serializer.errors`
4. If validation passes, the data can be saved with `serializer.save()`

Example of validation failure:
```python
# Future year example
future_year = datetime.now().year + 1
book_data = {
    'title': 'Future Book',
    'publication_year': future_year,
    'author': 1
}
serializer = BookSerializer(data=book_data)
serializer.is_valid()  # Returns False
serializer.errors  # Contains validation error
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Model Documentation

Both models include comprehensive docstrings explaining:
- The purpose of each model
- The attributes and their types
- The relationships between models
- String representations
- Meta options

### Serializer Documentation

Both serializers include detailed docstrings explaining:
- The purpose of each serializer
- The fields being serialized
- How nested relationships are handled
- Validation logic and business rules
- Method parameters and return values

### Relationship Handling

The implementation correctly handles the one-to-many relationship:
- One Author can have many Books
- One Book belongs to one Author
- Reverse lookups are enabled through `related_name='books'`
- Nested serialization is read-only to prevent accidental data modification

### Error Handling

Validation errors are properly handled:
- Clear error messages for users
- Standard DRF ValidationError exceptions
- Integration with DRF's error handling mechanisms
