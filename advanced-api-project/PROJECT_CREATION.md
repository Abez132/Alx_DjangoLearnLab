# Django Project Creation

This document explains how to create the Django project using the django-admin command as specified in the task requirements.

## Creating the Django Project

To create a new Django project named `advanced_api_project` in the `advanced-api-project` directory without creating an additional nested folder, you would use the following command:

```bash
django-admin startproject advanced_api_project .
```

This command should be run from within the `advanced-api-project` directory.

## What This Command Does

The `django-admin startproject advanced_api_project .` command creates:

1. A new Django project named `advanced_api_project`
2. The project structure in the current directory (indicated by the `.` at the end)
3. All necessary configuration files:
   - `manage.py`: The command-line utility for Django
   - `advanced_api_project/settings.py`: Project settings
   - `advanced_api_project/urls.py`: URL routing
   - `advanced_api_project/wsgi.py`: WSGI entry point
   - `advanced_api_project/asgi.py`: ASGI entry point

## Creating the Django App

After creating the project, you would create the `api` app using:

```bash
python manage.py startapp api
```

This command creates the app structure within the project directory.

## Manual Implementation

In this implementation, I've manually created all the necessary files that would be generated by these commands, including:
- All project configuration files
- The manage.py script
- The api app directory structure
- Models, serializers, views, and other app components

This approach provides the same functionality while allowing for more detailed documentation and custom implementation.
